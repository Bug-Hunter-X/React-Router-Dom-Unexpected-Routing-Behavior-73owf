# React Router Dom Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 that can cause unexpected routing behavior.  Specifically, under certain conditions (e.g., rapid navigation, component unmounting/mounting), the application might render a blank screen or fail to navigate correctly. The issue is not consistently reproducible but can be quite frustrating when it occurs.

The bug is related to how React Router handles component lifecycle events and may involve interactions with other libraries or state management solutions.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully managing component lifecycle methods (like `useEffect` with cleanup functions) and ensuring that any asynchronous operations related to routing or data fetching are properly handled.
